## Results
-The Pewlett Hackard Human Resources (HR) Department is preparing for several employees to retire. A quick query assisted HR in determining that 72,458 current staff, including position are eligible for retirement and can be viewed here: [retiring_title.csv](https://github.com/gforce2332/Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv)
- In light of the sheer numbers of employees eligible for retirement, HR is considering a mentorship program. Those eligible employees can be viewed here: [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/gforce2332/Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)
- From these table we are able to make the following determinations:
  - Nearly a third of the retirees are Senior Engineers while another third are Senior Staff.
  - Given the high numbers of senior staff retiring this will be a priority for HR to fill. 
  - There are only 1549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.
  - There are several more employees retiring than potential mentors. This should be a point of emphasis for the company to eliminate such a large learning curve going forward.
